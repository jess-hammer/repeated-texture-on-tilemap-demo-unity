# Repeated texture on a tilemap
This is a demo of a very simple shader that overlays a texture across a tilemap using Unity 2022.3.42f1

## The texture:
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd4db28c-d90a-49fc-bec7-2bae51e83686" width="300" title="Example texture (screenshot)">

## The result:
<img width="1438" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-23 at 12 57 14 pm" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64074aee-7720-4e84-b46a-ba939100a721">


## Example tile set:
It will only overlay the provided texture across the parts of the tiles that are fully red, so that the edges can be preserved in the final result.
